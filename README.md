# Threat Modeling
 Threat Modeling and tools
 
### What is threat modeling?
Threat modeling is analyzing representations of a system to highlight concerns about security and privacy characteristics.

At the highest levels, when we threat model, we ask four key questions:

* What are we working on?
* What can go wrong?
* What are we going to do about it?
* Did we do a good enough job?
